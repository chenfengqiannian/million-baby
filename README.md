The simplest dream

`The simplest quantitative trading, by analyzing the common features of the new currency,
And this feature will have universality, then the transaction can be quantified through this feature.

Simply put, suppose all new exchange currencies rise in the short term. Because of the exchange
The bookmaker will pull the plate, we will bet on the exchange of the new currency this feature. The program will buy new currency,
We'll hold it for the short term, [the short term could be a day, or an hour], maybe a %x premium.

There are two variables, short time and %x premium, which need to be perfected by the program.
And it needs to be followed for a long time.

All the program does is get the formula: the new currency on the exchange must be at a %y premium in x time

Everything in this formula is variable, like the new coin feature if in practice,
It turns out to be wrong, so we need to look at the formula again.
When the formula for our first condition is found, we can determine the time and premium by other factors.

If the data is large enough, more specific conditions can be abstracted from the various features of the currency.
